Here is example codes to quickly start up data pipeline in Azure using Terraform.
This will help overcome the learning curve of Azure deployment complexity.

## Strengths of using Azure for data pipelines

Scalability: Azure provides scalable solutions for data processing and storage. Services like Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks allow you to scale your data pipelines to handle large volumes of data efficiently. You can easily increase or decrease resources based on demand, ensuring optimal performance.

Broad range of data processing options: Azure offers a diverse set of data processing services, such as Azure HDInsight, Azure Functions, and Azure Stream Analytics. This allows you to choose the most suitable processing framework for your specific pipeline requirements, whether it's batch processing, real-time streaming, or serverless computing.

Robust ecosystem: Azure has a rich ecosystem of third-party tools and connectors that can be leveraged in data pipelines. This provides flexibility in integrating with various data sources and destinations, such as databases, data lakes, and external systems.

Security and compliance: Azure provides robust security measures and compliance certifications, making it suitable for handling sensitive data. Features like Azure Active Directory, encryption at rest and in transit, and Azure Key Vault ensure data protection and regulatory compliance.
